This dataset contains RNA-seq count data at 3 timepoints for DENV-naive and DENV-immune individuals with Zika infection. RNA-seq data was extracted from PAXgene RNA blood solution with the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit using DNase digestion and an additional clean-up using RNEasy MinElute kit. Entries contain subject sex, age, infection stage (early acute, late acute, and convalescent).

Question: To what extent can RNA-seq data be used to predict the stage of infection (early acute, late acute, or convalescent) in individuals with confirmed Zika infection.
