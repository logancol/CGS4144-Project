This dataset contains  RNA-seq count data at 3 timepoints for individuals exposed to and not exposed to Zika virus. RNA-seq data extracted from PAXgene RNA blood solution with the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit using DNase digestion and an additional clean-up using RNEasy MinElute kit. Entries contain subject sex, age, infection stage (early acute, late acute, and convalescent).

Tentative: Our question about this data considers how gene expression profiles might differ over time between Zika-exposed and Zika-na√Øve individuals.
